		<p>Sundown seems to embody the sheer power of an utterly romantic period in time. Just like love at  first sight, 
		it takes your breath away, leaves you speechless and if only for a moment, slows down time. In that instant, you 
		feel the love and gratitude for Mother Nature exude from every inch of your body(freepeople.org, 2015)</p>
